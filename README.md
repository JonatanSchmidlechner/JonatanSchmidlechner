# Welcome to My Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Jonatan Schmidlechner, a third year Computer science student majoring in software development and minoring in signal processing and machine learning. I will get my Bachelor's degree as soon as I just get my grades from Autumn 2024. This GitHub account is my portfolio showcasing various programming projects I've worked on. Below is a quick overview of the projects. Detailed information about each project can be found in its respective repository.

## Featured Projects
- **[Moduuler (demo) - Kitchen component 3d editing tool](https://github.com/JonatanSchmidlechner/Moduuler-demo):** Moduuler is a 3D editor application. It is intended to be used as a React component installed as an npm package in the parent application. As this project was done for a private company, I only show here a few individual code files, that I was responsible for. This project was done in Spring 2024 as part of the Software project 1 course. It is by far the most ambitious project I have been part of. The code files presented here demonstrate my coding skills in Typescript and React as well as some skills using Redux slices. As prior to this project I had no experience in web development, this also demonstrates my ability to learn new technologies fast. This project also demonstrates my knowledge about how to work in a small development team using agile methods.
- **[Tram-car audio classifier](https://github.com/JonatanSchmidlechner/tram-car_audioClassifier):** This project is a machine learning based audio classifier for classifying new audiosamples either as car or tram. This is a smaller project done in a 2 person group in December 2024 for the course **Introduction to audio and speech processing**. This project demonstrates my basic audio processing knowledge with python as well as machine learning knowledge.
- **[Sisu - Study planning application](https://github.com/JonatanSchmidlechner/Sisu-application):** Sisu is a study planning application with a graphical user interface, implemented in Java. Sisu was done in a 3 person group in Spring 2023 for programming 3 course. Although I was only a first year student at this time (note that programming 3 is normally meant for 2nd year students), I think it still demonstrates object oriented coding skills and group working skills. Further, it's the only relatively big group project done from scratch that I can fully show. For Sisu I was responsible for getting complex data (degrees and their contents) from an external API, creating required objects (degrees, study modules, courses and assessments) and storing them in a data structure.
